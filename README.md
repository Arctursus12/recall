# Recall 
<sup>Name STC</sup><br>
Memory management framework for creating a persistent "AI" with highly personalized functionality.<br>

## Goal
The goal with Recall is to create a framework that will work in perpetuity with newly developing language-oriented "AI" systems.<br>
At the moment, that means LLMs, but with organizations such as [Real Good AI](https://www.realgoodai.org) seeking to innovate in the field, the design intent with Recall is to have it be compatible with future **and** past technologies in perpetuity, and to allow existing configurations of it to be upgraded to keep up with technological advancement.<br>
## Feedback
I am not a skilled programmer, and this project is being developed in parallel to many other obligations and hobbies ongoing in my life.<br>
<sup>Half this code will likely be written with heavy Claude Code and GPT usage.</sup><br>
As such, updates and development will likely be slow, features will be broken, and many issues will likely pass by me unnoticed. As such, if you experience any issues or notice any flaws in my work, feel free to open an issue! I'll fix bugs as fast as I physically can, and would very much appreciate advice from more experienced peers in the field.<br>
## Contribution
While this is primarily a personal passion project, contributions are welcome!<br>
Bear in mind there is no guarantee your addition or edit will be implemented â€“ if you want to help, it's best to provide **feedback** instead.<br>
## License
At least for the time being, Recall is being licensed under **Apache 2.0**. This is primarily to future-proof, for the slim circumstance that it picks up steam and potentially encounters any friction.<br>
Recall as a piece of software, at the very least until it is "complete," will be **FOSS**, and will remain so permanently. Whether or not I will at later points allow monetization of forks or derivatives of the project will depend on whether or not it ever reaches that point, when it reaches that point, and in what state it does so.<br>
